Command:
> python ../../comcom.py -b 1
Expected Output:
- A series of pages that don't cut through bubbles/text but do cut on available whitespace between panels
Common Error Output:
- [Issue #8] Long running times (~200sec ~= 3.5 min)
- [Issue #33] The first page is too long and looks like it should have had a break in the middle (two areas of whitespace between panels)
- A single page due to lots of art and no discernible 'panel whitespace' (via `-b 0`)
