Command:
> python ../../comcom.py -m 300
Expected Output:
- Each 'page' is no less than 300 pixels high
- The first 2 pages should contain 2 images each (with the final 5th image being on it's own)
Common Error Output:
- [Issue #15] The algorithm doesn't start checking for min-height until after the next image after the page passes the min height.  In this case, min-height of 300 isn't passed until after 2 images are stitched together, and then it checks the third image for whitespace at the bottom and performs the break at the end of that third image.

Command:
> python ../../comcom.py -m 300 -b 1
Expected Output:
- Each 'page' is no less than 300 pixels high
Common Error Output:
- [Issue #34] No cropping/splitting occurred at all....
